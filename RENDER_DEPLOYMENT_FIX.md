# Render Deployment Fix - Missing Build Scripts

## 🔧 Issue Identified
Your deployment failed because:
1. `package.json` is missing the required `build` script
2. `next.config.js` has Flask backend rewrites that won't work on Render

## ✅ Solutions Created

### 1. Fixed package.json (`package-render.json`)
Created a proper Next.js package.json with required scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build", 
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed next.config.js
Removed Flask backend rewrites since your API routes are now native Next.js routes.

## 📋 Updated Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Your GitHub Repository
Replace these files in your repository:

1. **Replace `package.json`** with the contents of `package-render.json`
2. **Update `next.config.js`** with the fixed version (Flask rewrites removed)
3. **Keep `render.yaml`** as is (already correct)

### Step 2: File Structure for Render
Your repository should have:
```
📁 eleakxdown-free/
├── 📁 app/api/ (your Next.js API routes)
├── 📁 components/
├── 📁 public/
├── package.json (updated with build scripts)
├── next.config.js (fixed, no Flask rewrites)
├── tsconfig.json
├── render.yaml
└── README.md
```

### Step 3: Redeploy on Render
1. Push updated files to GitHub
2. Render will automatically rebuild
3. Build will now succeed with proper scripts

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Before (Broken):
- ❌ Missing `npm run build` script
- ❌ Flask backend rewrites pointing to non-existent server
- ❌ Build fails immediately

### After (Working):
- ✅ Proper Next.js build scripts
- ✅ Native API routes work directly
- ✅ Clean build process
- ✅ Full video download functionality

## 🚀 Expected Build Process on Render

1. **Install dependencies** - `npm ci`
2. **Build Next.js app** - `npm run build` (now works!)
3. **Install yt-dlp** - Automatic on Render
4. **Install FFmpeg** - Automatic on Render
5. **Start server** - `npm start`

## 📞 Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Replace package.json with updated version
- [ ] Update next.config.js (remove Flask rewrites)
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub
- [ ] Render rebuilds automatically
- [ ] Test video downloads (should work!)

Your E-LEAKxDOWN app will now build successfully on Render and have full video download capabilities!
