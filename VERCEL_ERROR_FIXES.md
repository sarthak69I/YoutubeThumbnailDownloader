# Vercel Deployment Error Fixes

## Error: "functions" property cannot be used with "builds" property

### Problem:
Vercel showed error because `vercel.json` had both `builds` and `functions` properties, which is not allowed in the same configuration.

### Solution:
Removed the conflicting `builds` property and kept only the necessary configurations:

### Fixed vercel.json:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/*/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
          "value": "*"
        },
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
          "value": "GET, POST, OPTIONS"
        },
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
          "value": "Content-Type"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### What Was Removed:
- `"version": 2` - Not needed for Next.js apps
- `"builds"` array - Conflicts with `functions` property
- `"env"` - Environment variables handled automatically
- `"rewrites"` - Not needed for API routes

### What Remained:
- `functions` configuration for 30-second timeout
- CORS headers for API routes
- Clean, minimal configuration

## Next Steps:
1. Update your repository with the fixed `vercel.json`
2. Commit and push changes
3. Redeploy on Vercel
4. Deployment should now succeed

Your E-LEAKxDOWN app with unlimited downloads and slow internet optimization is now ready for successful Vercel deployment.
